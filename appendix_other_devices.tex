\section{NM-CNT Quantum Dots}

Made to check nanotube growth and other fabrication techniques. Palladium leads showed very low room temperature resistances of about \SI{20}{\kilo\ohm}. It was thought that by using a metal that makes very good contacts, fabrication problems with other materials might be easier to pinpoint.

\section{Majorana Ferimons in CNTs}

Show some pictures. Briefly explain devices

\section{CNT Tunnel Probe into Aluminum Nanowires}

\section{Top Gated Quantum Dots}

Show data from one quantum dot with a top gate. Calculate capacitance ratio. Mention ALD being built for this purpose.
