\chapter{Metallic Contacts to Carbon Nanotubes}
\label{sec:contacts}
\chaptermark{Contacts to CNTs}

Chapter will contain: an explanation of the nature of metal-nanotube interfaces, statistics on metals tested, thin film deposition methods, and lithography methods. opinions will be backed up with a lot of histograms, contact resistance data, and device images. It's not the most exciting chapter, but it is what I spent a great deal of time thinking about over the past two years.
