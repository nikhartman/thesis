\section{Characteristics of Measured Samples}

Summarize the characteristics of the quantum dots measured. Fabrication, room temperature resistances, quantum dot specs.

\section{Tunneling Magnetoresistance}

Discuss the magnetoresistance data. Include data showing quadratic behavior over large field sweep. Also, discuss bias/field sweep showing some interesting behavior right around zero field.

\section{Cotunneling at Positive Bias}

Discuss that sample that showed some cotunneling states at positive bias/zero field. Do your best to come up with an explanation that fits those two criteria.

\section{Negative Differential Conductance in Magnetic Field}

Show data with negative differential conductance at finite field. Maybe the explanation for that fits with what was seen in the previous section.
