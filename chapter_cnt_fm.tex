\chaptermark{Ferromagnetic CNTQD}


This chapter will describe the techniques tested and used to create carbon nanotube quantum dots with ferromagnetic leads. Data will also be presented on a few devices that worked very well and showed an interesting level splitting on the dot. More data, at lower temperatures, would be great to explain that behavior. Currently, the data I have shows a level appearing at $\sim$\SI{1}{\tesla}, possibly related to some Kondo physics, that vanishes at zero field. This data was taken at 4K in our dunker.
