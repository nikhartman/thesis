\chaptermark{Properties of CNTs}

Carbon nanotubes exhibit a variety of interesting material and electrical properties. Nanotubes can be used as mechanical oscillators, one dimensional conductors, and quantum dots, among many other applications. The work in this thesis takes advantage of the unique electronic and spin transport properties of carbon nanotubes. By starting with the graphene lattice, these properties are easily derived.
