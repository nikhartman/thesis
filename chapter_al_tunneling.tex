\chaptermark{Tunnel Probe}

A carbon nanotube quantum dot is used as a tunnel probe into the density of states of a narrow aluminum wire placed on top of the quantum dot. The goal is to corroborate some of Tyler's Weber blockade results.

Many devices have been produced, some have worked, but the Al-CNT resistance has been too large to be useful. This device is currently the focus of my fabrication efforts. There is some data showing that the aluminum wire does not affect the behavior of the quantum dot underneath, and is itself superconducting with the expected $T_c$.
