%% This is going to be my carbon nanotube chapter. It should be based almost completely on GBO notes

\chapter{Spin Transport in Tunable Ferromagnet/Superconductor Junction}
\label{sec:SCFM}
\chaptermark{FM-CNT-SC}

Two samples to discuss. MT7 and scfmh8 (possibly scfmh2,5 as well). Low resolution Bias/Field sweeps of MT7. Interesting switching behavior in scfmh8 at low field.
