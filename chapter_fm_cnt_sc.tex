\chapter{Spin Transport in Tunable Ferromagnet/Superconductor Junction}
\label{sec:SCFM}
\chaptermark{FM-CNT-SC}

This chapter will first discuss techniques used in creating FM-CNT-SC devices. A lot of work has gone into making devices with contact resistances low enough to measure quantum dot behavior. More than 500 of these junctions have been made and characterized at room temperature. Only a few low temperature measurements have been made so far.

Existing measurements show unexpected switching behavior in the resistance as a function of magnetic field. There is the expected switching of the ferromagnetic leads, as well as an additional switching at higher fields that has yet to be explained. An attempt at explaining this data is pending, in hopes of making some additional measurements.

The goal of the project is to use the tunability of the  nanotube quantum dot (levels are spin split due to presence of FM lead) to characterize the the properties of the ferromagnet and superconductor. It should also be possible to use the quantum dot to tune the spin dependent tunneling through the device. That may be what the data mentioned above shows.
