abstract = {The connection of electrical leads to wire-like molecules is a logical step in the development of molecular electronics, but also allows studies of fundamental physics. For example, metallic carbon nanotubes are quantum wires that have been found to act as one-dimensional quantum dots, Luttinger liquids, proximity-induced superconductors and ballistic and diffusive one-dimensional metals. Here we report that electrically contacted single-walled carbon nanotubes can serve as powerful probes of Kondo physics, demonstrating the universality of the Kondo effect. Arising in the prototypical case from the interaction between a localized impurity magnetic moment and delocalized electrons in a metallic host, the Kondo effect has been used to explain enhanced low-temperature scattering from magnetic impurities in metals, and also occurs in transport through semiconductor quantum dots. The far greater tunability of dots (in our case, nanotubes) compared with atomic impurities renders new classes of Kondo-like effects accessible. Our nanotube devices differ from previous systems in which Kondo effects have been observed, in that they are one-dimensional quantum dots with three-dimensional metal (gold) reservoirs. This allows us to observe Kondo resonances for very large electron numbers (N) in the dot, and approaching the unitary limit (where the transmission reaches its maximum possible value). Moreover, we detect a previously unobserved Kondo effect, occurring for even values of N in a magnetic field.},

abstract = {The transport properties of a quantum dot that is weakly coupled to leads are investigated by using the exact quantum states of a finite number of interacting electrons. It is shown that, in addition to the Coulomb blockade, spin selection rules strongly influence the low temperature transport and lead to experimentally observable effects. Transition probabilities between states that correspond to successive electron numbers vanish if the total spins differ by ∣∣$\Delta$S∣∣>12. In nonlinear transport, this can lead to negative differential conductances. The linear conductance peaks are suppressed if transitions between successive ground states are forbidden.},

abstract = {Semiconducting carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have several properties that are advantageous for field effect transistors such as high mobility, good electrostatics due to their small diameter allowing for aggressive gate length scaling and capability to withstand high current densities. However, in spite of the exceptional performance of single transistors only a few simple circuits and logic gates using CNTs have been demonstrated so far. One of the major obstacles for large scale integration of CNTs is to reliably fabricate p-type and n-type ohmic contacts. To achieve this, the nature of Schottky barriers that often form between metals and small diameter CNTs has to be fully understood. However, since experimental techniques commonly used to study contacts to bulk materials cannot be exploited and studies often have been performed on only single or a few devices there is a large discrepancy in the Schottky barrier heights reported and also several contradicting conclusions. This paper presents a comprehensive review of both theoretical and experimental results on CNT-metal contacts. The main focus is on comparisons between theoretical predictions and experimental results and identifying what needs to be done to gain further understanding of Schottky barriers in CNT-metal contacts.},

abstract = {Although electron spins in III-V semiconductor quantum dots have shown great promise as qubits, hyperfine decoherence remains a major challenge in these materials. Group IV semiconductors possess dominant nuclear species that are spinless, allowing qubit coherence times up to 2 s. In carbon nanotubes, where the spin-orbit interaction allows for all-electrical qubit manipulation, theoretical predictions of the coherence time vary by at least six orders of magnitude and range up to 10 s or more. Here, we realize a qubit encoded in two nanotube valley-spin states, with coherent manipulation via electrically driven spin resonance mediated by a bend in the nanotube. Readout uses Pauli blockade leakage current through a double quantum dot. Arbitrary qubit rotations are demonstrated and the coherence time is measured for the first time via Hahn echo, allowing comparison with theoretical predictions. The coherence time is found to be ∼65 ns, probably limited by electrical noise. This shows that, even with low nuclear spin abundance, coherence can be strongly degraded if the qubit states are coupled to electric fields.},

Spin-entanglement between just two electrons can be explored in such systems where singlet and triplet states are accessible. These two spin-states can be regarded as the two states in a quantum two-state system, a so-called singlet-triplet qubit. A very attractive material for realizing spin based qubits is the carbon nanotube (CNT), because it is expected to have a very long spin coherence time. Here we show the existence of a gate-tunable singlet-triplet qubit in a CNT DQD. We show that the CNT DQD has clear shell structures of both four and eight electrons, with the singlet-triplet qubit present in the four-electron shells. We furthermore observe inelastic cotunneling via the singlet and triplet states, which we use to probe the splitting between singlet and triplet, in good agreement with theory.},

In the bias-current versus magnetic-field plane, the strip conductance displays regions of small vortex conductance (i.e., small electrical resistance) that we term "Weber blockade" diamonds, which are dual to Coulomb blockade diamonds in quantum dots.},

abstract = {Electronic transport through nanostructures is greatly affected by the presence of superconducting leads. If the interface between the nanostructure and the superconductors is sufficiently transparent, a dissipationless current (supercurrent) can flow through the device owing to the Josephson effect. A Josephson coupling, as measured by the zero-resistance supercurrent, has been obtained using tunnel barriers, superconducting constrictions, normal metals and semiconductors. The coupling mechanisms vary from tunnelling to Andreev reflection. The latter process has hitherto been observed only in normal-type systems with a continuous density of electronic states. Here we investigate a supercurrent flowing through a discrete density of states-that is, the quantized single particle energy states of a quantum dot, or 'artificial atom', placed between superconducting electrodes. For this purpose, we exploit the quantum properties of finite-sized carbon nanotubes. By means of a gate electrode, successive discrete energy states are tuned on- and off-resonance with the Fermi energy in the superconducting leads, resulting in a periodic modulation of the critical current and a non-trivial correlation between the conductance in the normal state and the supercurrent. We find, in good agreement with existing theory, that the product of the critical current and the normal state resistance becomes an oscillating function, in contrast to being constant as in previously explored regimes.},

@article{Soe2000,
abstract = {For CD (critical dimension) control with high accuracy, it is important to correct the proximity effect as well as to compensate the shape bias in electron beam lithography (EBL). In this work, we propose a method for determining the proximity effect parameters and the shape bias parameter concurrently. Due to the beam current instability of the E-beam writer, it is difficult to determine the parameters of the forward scattering range by delineating sub-0.1 ??m patterns. Accordingly, it is important to determine the proximity effect parameters without the errors that can occur in delineating sub-0.1 ??m patterns. Though the pattern bias has a small value such as tens-nm, it affects the CD control at sub-micron regime. For demonstrating the accuracy of the parameters, proximity effect correction (PEC) is carried out using the conventional dose modulation method after shape bias compensation. The variation of CD errors for Lines and Spaces (L\&S) patterns with PEC is less than 4\% using the obtained parameters.},

abstract = {A common feature of the single-walled carbon-nanotube field-effect transistors fabricated to date has been the presence of a Schottky barrier at the nanotube--metal junctions. These energy barriers severely limit transistor conductance in the 'ON' state, and reduce the current delivery capability--a key determinant of device performance. Here we show that contacting semiconducting single-walled nanotubes by palladium, a noble metal with high work function and good wetting interactions with nanotubes, greatly reduces or eliminates the barriers for transport through the valence band of nanotubes. In situ modification of the electrode work function by hydrogen is carried out to shed light on the nature of the contacts. With Pd contacts, the 'ON' states of semiconducting nanotubes can behave like ohmically contacted ballistic metallic tubes, exhibiting room-temperature conductance near the ballistic transport limit of 4e(2)/h (refs 4-6), high current-carrying capability (approximately 25 micro A per tube), and Fabry-Perot interferences at low temperatures. Under high voltage operation, the current saturation appears to be set by backscattering of the charge carriers by optical phonons. High-performance ballistic nanotube field-effect transistors with zero or slightly negative Schottky barriers are thus realized.},

abstract = {Field-effect transistors fabricated on graphene grown by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) often exhibit large hysteresis accompanied by low mobility, high positive backgate voltage corresponding to the minimum conductivity point (V(min)), and high intrinsic carrier concentration (n(0)). In this report, we show that the mobility reported to date for CVD graphene devices on SiO(2) is limited by trapped water between the graphene and SiO(2) substrate, impurities introduced during the transfer process and adsorbates acquired from the ambient. We systematically study the origin of the scattering impurities and report on a process which achieves the highest mobility ($\mu$) reported to date on large-area devices for CVD graphene on SiO(2): maximum mobility ($\mu$(max)) of 7800 cm(2)/(V·s) measured at room temperature and 12,700 cm(2)/(V·s) at 77 K. These mobility values are close to those reported for exfoliated graphene on SiO(2) and can be obtained through the careful control of device fabrication steps including minimizing resist residue and non-aqueous transfer combined with annealing. It is also observed that CVD graphene is prone to adsorption of atmospheric species, and annealing at elevated temperature in vacuum helps remove these species.},

Thermal treatment above 300 C in vacuum was required to effectively remove resist residues on graphene surfaces. However, annealing at high temperature was found to concomitantly bring graphene in close contact with SiO(2) substrates and induce increased coupling between them, which leads to heavy hole doping and severe degradation of mobilities in graphene devices. To address this problem, a wet-chemical approach employing chloroform was developed in our study, which was shown to enable both intrinsic surfaces and enhanced electrical properties of graphene devices. Upon the recovery of intrinsic surfaces of graphene, the adsorption and assisted fibrillation of amyloid $\beta$-peptide (A$\beta$1-42) on graphene were electrically measured in real time.},

The conduction type of the CNTFETs was dependent on the work function of the contact metal, which suggests that Fermi level pinning at the metal/nanotube interface does not happen. Based on the two-probe and four-probe resistance measurements, it was shown that the carrier transport at the contact is explained by the edge contact model even in the diffusive regime. The chemical doping using F4TCNQ was effective to reduce not only the channel resistance but also the contact resistance. It has also been shown that the surface potential measurement based on the electrostatic force detection in the scanning probe microscopy was effective in studying the behavior of the CNTFETs such as the transient behavior and the effect of the defects. Finally, in the CNTFETs fabricated using plasma-enhanced (PE) CVD-grown nanotubes, most of the drain current could be modulated by the gate voltage with little non-depletable drain current suggesting the preferential growth of the nanotubes with semiconducting behavior.},

We have also measured an individual SWNT and found a level of noise which is smaller than the minimum expected. Another finding is the very low level of 1/f noise, which is significantly lower than previous observations. We propose two possible interpretations for this strong shot noise reduction: i) Transport within a rope takes place through a few nearly ballistic tubes within a rope and possibly involves non integer effective charges. ii) A substantial fraction of the tubes conduct with a strong reduction of effective charge (by more than a factor 50).},

These facilitate fast non-invasive readouts important for quantum information processing, shot noise and correlation measurements. However, creation of a device that unites a low-disorder nanotube with a low-loss microwave resonator has so far remained a challenge, due to fabrication incompatibility of one with the other. Employing a mechanical transfer method, we successfully couple a nanotube to a gigahertz superconducting matching circuit and thereby retain pristine transport characteristics such as the control over formation of, and coupling strengths between, the quantum dots. Resonance response to changes in conductance and susceptance further enables quantitative parameter extraction. The achieved near matching is a step forward promising high-bandwidth noise correlation measurements on high impedance devices such as quantum dot circuits.},

abstract = {The 1 ∕ f noise in individual semiconducting carbon nanotubes (s-CNT) in a field effect transistor configuration has been measured in ultrahigh vacuum and following exposure to air. The amplitude of the normalized current spectral noise density is independent of source-drain current and inversely proportional to gate voltage, to channel length, and therefore to carrier number, indicating that the noise is due to mobility rather than number fluctuations. Hooge’s constant for s-CNT is found to be ( 9.3 ± 0.4 ) × 10 − 3 The magnitude of the 1 ∕ f noise is substantially decreased by exposing the devices to air.},

abstract = {Carbon nanotube field-effect transistors (CNTFETs) fabricated out of as-grown nanotubes are unipolar p-type devices. Two methods for their conversion from p- to n-type devices are presented. The first method involves conventional doping with an electron donor, while the second consists of annealing the contacts in vacuum to remove adsorbed oxygen. A comparison of these methods shows fundamental differences in the mechanism of the transformation. The key finding is that the main effect of oxygen adsorption is not to dope the bulk of the tube, but to modify the barriers at the metal-semiconductor contacts. The oxygen concn. and the level of doping of the nanotube are therefore complementary in controlling the CNTFET characteristics. Finally, a method of controlling individually the contact barriers by local heating is demonstrated.},

abstract = {The electrical noise characteristics of single-walled carbon nanotubes have been investigated. For all three cases of individual isolated nanotubes, thin films of interconnected nanotubes, and bulk nanotube mats, anomalously large bias-dependent 1/f noise is found. The noise magnitude greatly exceeds that commonly observed in metal films, carbon resistors, or even carbon fibers with comparable resistances. A single empirical expression describes the noise for all nanotube samples, suggesting a common noise-generating mechanism proportional only to the number of nanotubes in the conductor. We consider likely sources of the fluctuations, and consequences for electronic applications of nanotubes if the excessive noise cannot be suppressed.},

A variation of the conduction type with temperature is also observed and is attributed to an increase of the palladium work function and decrease of the CNT work function with increasing temperature.},

abstract = {A dry transfer process for single-walled carbon nanotubes allows for suspended, ultraclean, and hysteresis-free nanotube field-effect transistors on micro-actuated electrodes without exposing the device die to elevated nanotube growth temperatures. Nanotubes are grown on a separate die, between the arms of a fork structure, and are subsequently transferred onto receiving electrodes of a device die. The device die is maintained at room-temperature; and thus, it can in principle contain temperature-sensitive readout circuitry. The liquid-free, room-temperature transfer is performed under light microscopy observation, while placement is detected by monitoring the current through the device electrodes. In contrast to manipulation under electron beam observation, electron-beam-induced carbonaceous contamination is prevented. Moreover, pre-selection of nanotubes by Raman spectroscopy is rendered possible, avoiding any contamination of the nanomaterial during selection and integration into NEMS.},

At moderate temperatures (T < 880 K), thermal processing results in high resistance contacts with thermally activated barriers. Higher temperatures (T > 880 K) achieve nearly transparent contacts. In the latter case, analytical surface measurements reveal the catalytic decomposition of hydrocarbons into graphene layers on the Pt surface, suggesting that improved electronic behavior is primarily due to the formation of an all-carbon nanotube-graphite interface rather than to the improvement of the nanotube-Pt one.},

abstract = {We study the interface between carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and surface-deposited titanium using electron microscopy and photoemission spectroscopy, supported by density functional calculations. Charge transfer from the Ti atoms to the nanotube and carbide formation is observed at the interface which indicates strong interaction. Nevertheless, the presence of oxygen between the Ti and the CNTs significantly weakens the Ti-CNT interaction. Ti atoms at the surface will preferentially bond to oxygenated sites. Potential sources of oxygen impurities are examined, namely oxygen from any residual atmosphere and pre-existing oxygen impurities on the nanotube surface, which we enhance through oxygen plasma surface pre-treatment. Variation in literature data concerning Ohmic contacts between Ti and carbon nanotubes is explained via sample pre-treatment and differing vacuum levels, and we suggest improved treatment routes for reliable Schottky barrier-free Ti-nanotube contact formation.},

@article{Ganzhorn2013,
abstract = {Magnetic relaxation processes were first discussed for a crystal of paramagnetic transition ions. It was suggested that mechanical vibrations of the crystal lattice (phonons) modulate the crystal electric field of the magnetic ion, thus inducing a 'direct' relaxation between two different spin states. Direct relaxation has also been predicted for single-molecule magnets with a large spin and a high magnetic anisotropy and was first demonstrated in a Mn12 acetate crystal. The spin-lattice relaxation time for such a direct transition is limited by the phonon density of states at the spin resonance. In a three-dimensional system, such as a single-molecule magnet crystal, the phonon energy spectrum is continuous, but in a one-dimensional system, like a suspended carbon nanotube, the spectrum is discrete and can be engineered to an extremely low density of states. An individual single-molecule magnet, coupled to a suspended carbon nanotube, should therefore exhibit extremely long relaxation times and the system's reduced size should result in a strong spin-phonon coupling. Here, we provide the first experimental evidence for a strong spin-phonon coupling between a single molecule spin and a carbon nanotube resonator, ultimately enabling coherent spin manipulation and quantum entanglement.},

abstract = {We demonstrate that ultraclean single, double, and triple quantum dots (QDs) can be formed reliably in a carbon nanotube (CNT) by a straightforward fabrication technique. The QDs are electrostatically defined in the CNT by closely spaced metallic bottom gates deposited in trenches in SiO2 by sputter deposition of Re. The carbon nanotubes are then grown by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) across the trenches and contacted using conventional resist-based electron beam lithography. Unlike in previous work, the devices exhibit reproducibly the characteristics of ultraclean QDs behavior even after the subsequent electron beam lithography and chemical processing steps. We specifically demonstrate the high quality using CNT devices with two narrow bottom gates and one global back gate. Tunable by the gate voltages, the device can be operated in four different regimes: (i) fully p-type with ballistic transport between the outermost contacts (over a length of 700 nm), (ii) clean n-type single QD behavior where a QD can be induced by either the left or the right bottom gate, (iii) n-type double QD, and (iv) triple bipolar QD where the middle QD has opposite doping (p-type). Our simple fabrication scheme opens up a route to more complex devices based on ultraclean CNTs, since it allows for postgrowth processing.},

abstract = {Electrons in atoms possess both spin and orbital degrees of freedom. In non-relativistic quantum mechanics, these are independent, resulting in large degeneracies in atomic spectra. However, relativistic effects couple the spin and orbital motion, leading to the well-known fine structure in their spectra. The electronic states in defect-free carbon nanotubes are widely believed to be four-fold degenerate, owing to independent spin and orbital symmetries, and also to possess electron-hole symmetry. Here we report measurements demonstrating that in clean nanotubes the spin and orbital motion of electrons are coupled, thereby breaking all of these symmetries. This spin-orbit coupling is directly observed as a splitting of the four-fold degeneracy of a single electron in ultra-clean quantum dots. The coupling favours parallel alignment of the orbital and spin magnetic moments for electrons and antiparallel alignment for holes. Our measurements are consistent with recent theories that predict the existence of spin-orbit coupling in curved graphene and describe it as a spin-dependent topological phase in nanotubes. Our findings have important implications for spin-based applications in carbon-based systems, entailing new design principles for the realization of quantum bits (qubits) in nanotubes and providing a mechanism for all-electrical control of spins in nanotubes.},

abstract = {The quantum behaviour of mechanical resonators is a new and emerging field driven by recent experiments reaching the quantum ground state. The high frequency, small mass, and large quality-factor of carbon nanotube resonators make them attractive for quantum nanomechanical applications. A common element in experiments achieving the resonator ground state is a second quantum system, such as coherent photons or a superconducting device, coupled to the resonators motion. For nanotubes, however, this is a challenge due to their small size. Here, we couple a carbon nanoelectromechanical (NEMS) device to a superconducting circuit. Suspended carbon nanotubes act as both superconducting junctions and moving elements in a Superconducting Quantum Interference Device (SQUID). We observe a strong modulation of the flux through the SQUID from displacements of the nanotube. Incorporating this SQUID into superconducting resonators and qubits should enable the detection and manipulation of nanotube mechanical quantum states at the single-phonon level.},

abstract = {Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) have many exceptional electronic properties. Realizing the full potential of SWNTs in realistic electronic systems requires a scalable approach to device and circuit integration. We report the use of dense, perfectly aligned arrays of long, perfectly linear SWNTs as an effective thin-film semiconductor suitable for integration into transistors and other classes of electronic devices. The large number of SWNTs enable excellent device-level performance characteristics and good device-to-device uniformity, even with SWNTs that are electronically heterogeneous. Measurements on p- and n-channel transistors that involve as many as approximately 2,100 SWNTs reveal device-level mobilities and scaled transconductances approaching approximately 1,000 cm(2) V(-1) s(-1) and approximately 3,000 S m(-1), respectively, and with current outputs of up to approximately 1 A in devices that use interdigitated electrodes. PMOS and CMOS logic gates and mechanically flexible transistors on plastic provide examples of devices that can be formed with this approach. Collectively, these results may represent a route to large-scale integrated nanotube electronics.},

abstract = {We report on the influence of low gamma irradiation (10(4) Gy) on the noise properties of individual carbon nanotube (CNT) field-effect transistors (FETs) with different gate configurations and two different dielectric layers, SiO2 and Al2O3. Before treatment, strong generation-recombination (GR) noise components are observed. These data are used to identify several charge traps related to dielectric layers of the FETs by determining their activation energy. Investigation of samples with a single SiO2 dielectric layer as well as with two dielectric layers allows us to separate traps for each of the two dielectric layers. We reveal that each charge trap level observed in the side gate operation splits into two levels in top gate operation due to a different potential profile along the CNT channel. After gamma irradiation, only reduced flicker noise is registered in the noise spectra, which indicates a decrease of the number of charge traps. The mobility, which is estimated to be larger than 2 × 10(4) cm(2) V(-1) s(-1) at room temperature, decreases only slightly after radiation treatment, demonstrating high radiation hardness of the CNTs. Finally, we study the influence of Schottky barriers at the metal-nanotube interface on the transport properties of FETs, analyzing the behavior of the flicker noise component.},

Two conductance peaks, observed at finite bias in nonlinear transport measurements, are found to approach each other for increasing magnetic field, to result in a recovered zero bias Kondo resonance at finite magnetic field. Surprisingly, in the same charge state, but under different gate configurations, the splitting does not disappear for any value of the magnetic field, but we observe an avoided crossing. We think that our observations can be understood in terms of a two-impurity Kondo effect with two spins coupled antiferromagnetically. The exchange coupling between the two spins can be influenced by a local gate, and the non-recovery of the Kondo resonance for certain gate configurations is explained by the existence of a small antisymmetric contribution to the exchange interaction between the two spins.},

abstract = {We report a one-step direct transfer technique for the fabrication of functional nanoelectronic devices using pristine single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs). Suspended SWNTs grown by the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method are aligned and directly transferred onto prepatterned device electrodes at ambient temperature. Using this technique, we successfully fabricated SWNT electromechanical resonators with gate-tunable resonance frequencies. A fully suspended SWNT p-n diode has also been demonstrated with the diode ideality factor equal to 1. Our method eliminates the organic residues on SWNTs resulting from conventional lithography and solution processing. The results open up opportunities for the fundamental study of electron transport physics in ultraclean SWNTs and for room temperature fabrication of novel functional devices based on pristine SWNTs.},

@article{Pei2012,
abstract = {The manipulation and readout of spin qubits in quantum dots have been successfully achieved using Pauli blockade, which forbids transitions between spin-triplet and spin-singlet states. Compared with spin qubits realized in III-V materials, group IV materials such as silicon and carbon are attractive for this application because of their low decoherence rates (nuclei with zero spins). However, valley degeneracies in the electronic band structure of these materials combined with Coulomb interactions reduce the energy difference between the blocked and unblocked states, significantly weakening the selection rules for Pauli blockade. Recent demonstrations of spin qubits in silicon devices have required strain and spatial confinement to lift the valley degeneracy. In carbon nanotubes, Pauli blockade can be observed by lifting valley degeneracy through disorder, but this makes the confinement potential difficult to control. To achieve Pauli blockade in low-disorder nanotubes, quantum dots have to be made ultrasmall, which is incompatible with conventional fabrication methods. Here, we exploit the bandgap of low-disorder nanotubes to demonstrate robust Pauli blockade based on both valley and spin selection rules. We use a novel stamping technique to create a bent nanotube, in which single-electron spin resonance is detected using the blockade. Our results indicate the feasibility of valley-spin qubits in carbon nanotubes.},

abstract = {An atomic force microscope was used to locally perturb and detect the charge density in carbon nanotubes. Changing the tip voltage varied the Fermi level in the nanotube. The local charge density increased abruptly whenever the Fermi level was swept through a van Hove singularity in the density of states, thereby coupling the cantilever's mechanical oscillations to the nanotube's local electronic properties. By using our technique to measure the local band gap of an intratube quantum-well structure, created by a nonuniform uniaxial strain, we have estimated the nanotube chiral angle. Our technique does not require attached electrodes or a specialized substrate, yielding a unique high-resolution spectroscopic tool that facilitates the comparison between local electronic structure of nanomaterials and further transport, optical, or sensing experiments.},

In this report, we demonstrate the directed and precise assembly of single-nanotube devices with an integration density of several million devices per square centimeter, using a novel aspect of nanotube dielectrophoresis. We show that the dielectrophoretic force fields change incisively as nanotubes assemble into the contact areas, leading to a reproducible directed assembly which is self-limiting in forming single-tube devices. Their functionality has been tested by random sampling of device characteristics using microprobes.},

abstract = {Nanoscale resonators that oscillate at high frequencies are useful in many measurement applications. We studied a high-quality mechanical resonator made from a suspended carbon nanotube driven into motion by applying a periodic radio frequency potential using a nearby antenna. Single-electron charge fluctuations created periodic modulations of the mechanical resonance frequency. A quality factor exceeding 10(5) allows the detection of a shift in resonance frequency caused by the addition of a single-electron charge on the nanotube. Additional evidence for the strong coupling of mechanical motion and electron tunneling is provided by an energy transfer to the electrons causing mechanical damping and unusual nonlinear behavior. We also discovered that a direct current through the nanotube spontaneously drives the mechanical resonator, exerting a force that is coherent with the high-frequency resonant mechanical motion.},

This size dependence can be clearly observed in single-walled carbon nanotubes, where changes in structure at the atomic scale can modify the electronic and optical properties of these materials in a discontinuous manner (for example, changing metallic nanotubes to semiconducting nanotubes and vice versa). However, as most practical technologies require predictable and uniform performance, researchers have been aggressively seeking strategies for preparing samples of single-walled carbon nanotubes with well-defined diameters, lengths, chiralities and electronic properties (that is, uniformly metallic or uniformly semiconducting). This review highlights post-synthetic approaches for sorting single-walled carbon nanotubes - including selective chemistry, electrical breakdown, dielectrophoresis, chromatography and ultracentrifugation - and progress towards selective growth of monodisperse samples.},

Defect-free, unperturbed single-walled carbon nanotubes with well behaved or tunable metal contacts are important for probing the intrinsic electrical properties of nanotubes. Meeting these conditions experimentally is non-trivial owing to numerous disorder and randomizing factors. Here we show that approximately 1-microm-long fully suspended single-walled carbon nanotubes grown in place between metal contacts afford devices with well defined characteristics over much wider energy ranges than nanotubes pinned on substrates. Various low-temperature transport regimes in true-metallic, small- and large-bandgap semiconducting nanotubes are observed, including quantum states shell-filling, -splitting and -crossing in magnetic fields owing to the Aharonov-Bohm effect. The clean transport data show a correlation between the contact junction resistance and the various transport regimes in single-walled-carbon-nanotube devices. Furthermore, we show that electrical transport data can be used to probe the band structures of nanotubes, including nonlinear band dispersion.},

abstract = {A simple method combining photolithography and shadow (or angle) evaporation is developed to fabricate single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) devices with tube lengths of approximately 10-50 nm between metal contacts. Large numbers of such short devices are obtained without the need of complex tools such as electron beam lithography. Metallic SWCNTs with lengths of approximately 10 nm, near the mean free path of l(op) approximately 15 nm for optical phonon scattering, exhibit nearly ballistic transport at high biases and can carry unprecedented 100-microA currents per tube. Semiconducting SWCNT field-effect transistors with approximately 50-nm channel lengths are routinely produced to achieve quasi-ballistic operations for molecular transistors. The results demonstrate highly length-scaled and high-performance interconnects and transistors realized with SWCNTs.},

@article{Jarillo-Herrero2004,
abstract = {Optical and electronic phenomena in solids arise from the behaviour of electrons and holes (unoccupied states in a filled electron sea). Electron-hole symmetry can often be invoked as a simplifying description, which states that electrons with energy above the Fermi sea behave the same as holes below the Fermi energy. In semiconductors, however, electron-hole symmetry is generally absent, because the energy-band structure of the conduction band differs from the valence band. Here we report on measurements of the discrete, quantized-energy spectrum of electrons and holes in a semiconducting carbon nanotube. By applying a voltage to a gate electrode, an individual nanotube is filled controllably with a precise number of either electrons or holes, starting from one. The discrete excitation spectrum for a nanotube with N holes is strikingly similar to the corresponding spectrum for N electrons. This observation of near-perfect electron-hole symmetry demonstrates that a semiconducting nanotube can be free of charged impurities, even in the limit of few electrons or holes. We furthermore find an anomalously small Zeeman spin splitting and an excitation spectrum indicating strong electron-electron interactions.},
